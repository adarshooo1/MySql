--UNION combines the result of two or more select statements.

Note:To UNION Table it is mandatory that both the table should have same content in terms of rows and columns.

Table expenses have 2 rows and 5 columns same as table income has.
cmd:select * from income
    union
    select * from expense;
    //It will merge the table income and expenses but the problem is both has 2 different aspects income and expense. which is written under the head income table header.

//So If we have a table which has not same number or columns and rows so, we find that what is common.
cmd:select first_Name , last_Name from employees
    UNION/UNION ALL
    select first_Name , last_Name from buyers;

    //If suppose we have duplicate same so union will confuse so, Replace by UNION ALL will help in this case.
