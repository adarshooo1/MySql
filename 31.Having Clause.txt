Why use Having clause over where clause in mysql?
In MySQL and other SQL databases, the HAVING clause and the WHERE clause serve different purposes, primarily in the context of aggregate functions.

WHERE Clause:

The WHERE clause is used to filter rows before they are grouped and aggregated.
It is applied to individual rows before they become part of a group.
Typically used with non-aggregated columns to filter rows based on specific conditions.
Example: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'Shipped';

HAVING Clause:

The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of aggregate functions applied to groups of rows.
It is applied after the GROUP BY clause and after any aggregate functions have been calculated.
Used to filter groups based on aggregate conditions.
Example: SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY status HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
Here's a more concrete example to illustrate the difference:

#MySQL
-- Using WHERE clause
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
WHERE orderDate > '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY status
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;


In this example, the WHERE clause filters rows based on the orderDate condition before they are grouped. Then, the HAVING clause filters the groups based on the aggregate condition (COUNT(*) > 5).
In summary:

Use WHERE for filtering individual rows before grouping.
Use HAVING for filtering grouped results based on aggregate functions.
It's important to note that HAVING is only used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause. If you're not using GROUP BY, you would typically use WHERE to filter rows.
