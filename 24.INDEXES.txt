--INDEX (BTree data structure)
--INDEX are used to find values within a specigic column more quickly.
--MySql noramlly searches subquentially though a column
--The longer the column, the more expensive the operation is
--Update takes more time, select takes less time.

To create a single column indexes:
cmd:create indexes last_name_idx
    on customer last_name;
    //This helps in search faster

//To check on the table that what name is given created index on the table and where the index key is set on the table column.
cmd:show indexes from customer.  ;

To search faster with the indexing:
cmd:select * from customer
    where last_name = "Lohiya";
    //This will search more faster.

To create a multi column indexes:
cmd:CREATE INDEX last_name_first_name_idx
    ON customer(last_name , first_Name);

To search faster with the multi indexing:
cmd:show * from customer
    where last_name = "Lohiya" AND first_Name = "Mukesh";


To check indexes:
cmd:show indexes from customer;

To DROP INDEXES:
cmd:ALTER TABLE customer
    DROP INDEX last_name_idx;


//This will search from the most right index.
