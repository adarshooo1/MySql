To make a unique contraints in a new Table:
    cmd:create table products(
        product_id INT,
        product_name VARCHAR(25) UNIQUE,
        price Decimal(5,2)
    );

To make a unique contraints in an Old table:
    cmd:ALTER TABLE products
        ADD CONSTRAINTS
        UNIQUE(Product_Name)

If we have already make a table which have dupicate before making a 
unique contraints to the header of the table then making a table header will
not become a uniques contraints before updating the duplicate tale content.

Simply: Unique Constraints means item under the uniques contraint header should be different like product_id or produect name.
