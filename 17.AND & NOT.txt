In MySQL, the AND, OR, and NOT operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause to filter data from a table.
Here's how you can use these operators with comments:


1.AND Operator:
  The AND operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. The condition will be true only if all the conditions separated by AND are true.
cmd:SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE country = 'USA' -- Retrieve customers from USA
    AND city = 'New York' -- Retrieve customers from New York
    AND age > 30; -- Retrieve customers from New York who are older than 30

2.OR Operator:
  The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. The condition will be true if any of the conditions separated by OR is true.

cmd:SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE country = 'USA' -- Retrieve customers from USA
    OR city = 'New York' -- Retrieve customers from New York
    OR age > 30; -- Retrieve customers who are from USA or New York or older than 30

3.NOT Operator:
  The NOT operator is used to negate a condition in a WHERE clause. The condition will be true only if the negated condition is false.

cmd:SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE NOT country = 'USA'; -- Retrieve customers who are not from USA
