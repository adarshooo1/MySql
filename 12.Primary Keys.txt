PRIMARY KEY

To add a primary key in a new table:
cmd:create table Transaction(
    transaction_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMALS
);

To add a primary key constraint in an existing table:
cmd:Alter table Transaction
    Add CONSTRAINT
    PRIMARY KEY(transaction_Id);
//If Transaction_Id has the PRIMARY KEY than all the values inside the Transaction_Id should
  be different form each other.As well if we have set the PRIMARY KEY to the transaction_Id
  then we cannot add other PRIMARY KEY to the amount then we can't be able to make it as a PRIMARY KEY.

To remove a primary key from the table.
cmd:ALTER TABLE Transaction
    DROP CONSTRAINT Transaction_Id;

NOTE: [We can unly use one primary key to a single table.
      After adding primary key constraint we use only.]
