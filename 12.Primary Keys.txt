PRIMARY KEY

To add a primary key in a new table:
cmd:create table Transaction(
    transaction_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMALS(5 , 3) //Example:99999.999 - This is the limit to store the values till this amount.
);
//To Increase the size of the amount in DECIMALS:
cmd:ALTER TABLE Transaction
    MODIFY COLUMN Transaction DECIMAL(8,5);


To add a primary key constraint in an existing table:
cmd:Alter table Transaction
    Add CONSTRAINT
    PRIMARY KEY(transaction_Id);
//If Transaction_Id has the PRIMARY KEY than all the values inside the Transaction_Id should
  be different form each other.As well if we have set the PRIMARY KEY to the transaction_Id
  then we cannot add other PRIMARY KEY to the amount then we can't be able to make it as a PRIMARY KEY.

To remove or drop a primary key from the table.
cmd:ALTER TABLE Transaction
    DROP CONSTRAINT Transaction_Id;

    or,
    ALTER TABLE Transaction
    Drop primary Key;

To spectate which Transaction_Id has what amount:
cmd:SELECT amount
    from Transaction
    where Transaction_Id = 105;    



////////////////////////////////////
NOTE: [We can unly use one primary key to a single table. Example: Table Transaction we have a primary key at the Transaction_Id.
      After adding primary key constraint we can only use only one seperate name like uniuqe identificatio Ex: 101 , 102 , 103 , 104. If we tried to insert with the same transaction_Id then it will give error and till we don't use diffferent transaction_Id.
      After specifying the primary key on the specific header of the table the values inside the table cannot be null at the time of Inserting Values]
