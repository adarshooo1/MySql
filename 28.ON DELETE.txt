--ON DELETE SET NULL = When a FK is deleted , replace FK with NULL
--ON DELETE CASCADE = WHEN a FK is DELETED, delete row.
--FK stands for foreign Key.

//By Defalt ON DELETE & ON UPDATE is restricted in mysql.

So supppose we have 2 table and 
1.Table customer
2.Table Transaction

//In the customer table we have customer_id which is set as a primary key.

//In the table transaction we have set the foreign Key in the customer_id.

So, ON Delete is basically we are going to perform in the table which has the foreign key constraint.Because as we know that the table which have the foreign key.

//Foreign key is on the table transaction so we can delete anything without any restriction.

//But on the table customer there is the restriction to delete the row which has the foreign key constraint and linked with the table transaction. So,

//To delete the foreign-Key associated values :
cmd:set foreign_key_checks = 0;


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
To create a new table with ON DELETE:
cmd:-- create table transaction(
    -- customer_id int,
    -- transaction_id int auto_increment primary key,
    -- amont decimal (10,2),
    -- Transaction_date DATE,
    -- foreign key(customer_id) references customer(customer_id),
    -- ON DELETE SET NULL
    -- );

To set ON DELETE in Existing table.
//First we have to delete the foreign key to set ON DELETE SET NULL.
cmd1:ALTER TABLE Transaction DROP foreign Key fk_customer_id;

//We can now set like this.
cmd2:ALTER TABLE Transaction
ADD constraint fk_customer_id
foreign Key(customer_id references) customer(custoemr_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

//Now we can delete from transaction anyone customer_id.
cmd:delete from customer
    where customer_id = 4;


/////////////////ON DELETE CASCADE//////////////////////////////////
To set ON DELETE CASCADE IN A NEW TABLE;
cmd:-- create table transaction(
    -- customer_id int,
    -- transaction_id int auto_increment primary key,
    -- amont decimal (10,2),
    -- Transaction_date DATE,
    -- foreign key(customer_id) references customer(customer_id),
    -- ON DELETE CASCADE
    -- );

//TO set ON DELETE CASCADE IN EXISTING TABLE.
step 1.
//have have to drop the existing foreign;
step 2.
//Add the foreign key with IN DELETE CASCADE.
cmd:ALTER TABLE Transaction
    ADD constraint fk_customer_id
    foreign Key(customer_id references) customer(custoemr_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE;

    //Now when we delete any customer id then from table customer then all the transaction related history and record means his row will be delete when we delete customer_Id.
